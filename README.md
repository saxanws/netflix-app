# netflix-app

## Description

This is a clone of Netflix where I use a movie API to display movies on the screen. I did this project through a tutorial where I mostly learn how **scss** works. I was able to use the variables, nested css element. Also this project was made uing React as the JavaScript library.

## Technologies

I used `React.Js`, `SCSS`, and OMDB Api to fetch the movies and the TV Show.
